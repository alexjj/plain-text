_Little things I like to remember._

> You wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realised how seldom they do.
> *― Eleanor Roosevelt*

> Stop buying the unnecessary. Toss half your stuff, learn contentedness. Reduce half again. List 4 essential things in your life, do these first, stop doing the non-essential. Clear distractions, focus on each moment. Let go of attachment to doing, having more.
> Fall in love with less.
> *― https://mnmlist.com/less/*

> Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day  when you lounge around doing nothing; it's a day you've had everything  to do and you've done it.
> *― Margaret Thatcher: [Book.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3738214-as-i-said-to-dennis)*

> I can be happy anywhere.
> I can work with what I have.
> I can have a good day with anyone.
> *― James Clear of Atomic Habits.*
